# ETL Data Modeling with Postgres

## Introduction
This project demonstrates the concept of data modeling with PostgreSQL, which reinforces the basis for building an ETL data pipeline uising Python.
A startup wants to analyse the data collected on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The collected data resides in a directory of JSON formatted files. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to based on the data.

As a data engineer tasked to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis.

 Goals for this project are:
 1. Create a database schema
 2. Create an ETL pipeline for the analysis
 2. Test the created database and ETL pipeline running sample queries given by the anayltics team.
